# Recommended Front Ends
This is a list of sites that use front ends we could replicate in a workshop.

1. https://evernote.com/ (Good for entering text content on a form and displaying it on an index page)
1. https://www.udacity.com/ (Good for demonstrating good home page layouts with various content)
1. https://www.google.com/maps (Actually not difficult. Good for teaching use APIs to get content for front end)
1. https://www.meetup.com/ (The logged in page is good for displaying time-sensative data. Good for teaching view page construction that might involve conditional information)
